In a small town, there were 3 bakeries, each 
famous for their unique recipes. The first bakery 
specialized in sourdough bread, attracting customers from 
miles around. The second, located 5 blocks away, was renowned 
for its 7-layer cakes, which were a hit at every local event. 
On the other side of town, the third bakery boasted an array 
of pastries, with at least 9 different types available daily. Each 
bakery had its charm, but the competition was fierce. One sunny afternoon, 
a group of 4 friends decided to embark on a culinary adventure, aiming to 
visit each bakery and sample their signature dish. Their first stop was at 
the sourdough bakery, where they enjoyed 2 loaves of freshly baked bread. 
Next, they headed to the 7-layer cake shop, indulging in a slice each. 
Finally, they visited the pastry shop, where they were overwhelmed by the 
6 choices of croissants alone. Satisfied and full, they concluded their 
day, unanimously agreeing that their small town was indeed a hidden gem for 
food lovers.
